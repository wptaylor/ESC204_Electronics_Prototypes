# ESC204_Electronics_Prototypes

This project holds code for a BLE link between Arduino Nano RP2040's, UART NMEA logging of a Raspberry Pi Pico for the L76X GNSS module, and NMEA interpretation.

This program works in tandem with https://github.com/0xC000005/ESC204/ to provide a technical foundation for the ESC204 - Praxis III design course.

The L76X code was inspired by https://github.com/BritishTechGuru/PI-Pico-L76B.
